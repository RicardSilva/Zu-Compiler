# Compilers Project 2016 #

Project for the compilers course of the 2nd semester of 2016. 
The project objective was building a compiler in C++ for the language 'Zu'. The compiler was built using mainly visitors.

<b>Disclaimer</b>: The project was not completely finished due to time constraints, but it is pretty close to being complete. :)
